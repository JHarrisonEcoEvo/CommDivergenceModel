This program is not complete. When finished it will allow the user to specify certain starting conditions for a simulated metacommunity of hosts and associated microbes, including number of hosts, microbes, and communities. Then the model will simulate changes in communities due to ecological drift for a specified time period. 

We will likely add additional features to the model down the road.
